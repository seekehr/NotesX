# NotesX

A note-taking website made by me, for convenience sake (and as a lil project ;D). Intended features:
[x] Txt/md support 
[x] Live preview
[x] Custom format (discord based, allow colours)
[x] Discord message copy-paste support (automatically convert copy-pasted text to formatting in markdown).
[x] Seamless txt/md/any custom format conversion by preserving formatting data. For example, if md -> txt, preserve the original formatting.
[x] Note category support
[x] Notes sorted by categories. Categories have names (unique). Can be opened-closed with a lil arrow button. 
[x] Search with title/tags
[x] Store last opened note and open it by default
