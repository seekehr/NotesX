# NotesX

A note-taking website made by me, for convenience sake (and as a lil project ;D). Intended features:
- [ ] Txt/md support 
- [ ] Live preview
- [ ] Custom format (discord based, allow colours)
- [ ] Discord message copy-paste support (automatically convert copy-pasted text to formatting in markdown).
- [ ] Seamless txt/md/any custom format conversion by preserving formatting data. For example, if md -> txt, preserve the original formatting.
- [ ] Note category support
- [ ] Notes sorted by categories. Categories have names (unique). Can be opened-closed with a lil arrow button. 
- [ ] Search with title/tags
- [ ] Store last opened note and open it by default
